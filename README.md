# less-clicks-more-recruiting
Github was not made for recruiters to recruit. I'm often looking for  signals that indicate potentially good candidates, like forks and followers and stars, yada yada.  That means I have to do a boolean search and then click each profile individually just to find  a person's email, website, or linkedin, etc. I hate clicking things. I have to click buttons more than I'd like. I just want to run something and have all the info infront of me without all the unnecessary clicking. I'm calling the Github API and using python and dash to just generate the list i need on my screen. It's ugly looking but at least I don't have to click
